/* NOTE:
 * These numbers are empirically gathered from a few different games thus far.
 * There are many notes floating around the internet of the GB Printer having
 * a 100 ms limit between packets where it will reset. However, I've seen
 * Pokemon Pinball wait 99.5 ms between packets after a print command which is
 * a bit too close for comfort. As this code tracks timestamps _after_ each byte,
 * that ends up just over 110 ms which trips the hard timeout and resets state.
 * This often cofuses the hell out of games.
 *
 * Additionally, on the other end of the spectrum, Pokemon Gold absolutely uses
 * the hard timeout to reset the printer between packets. It waits ~278 ms, when
 * it could just send an init command.
 *
 * Even more silly, Pokemon Pinball has a fun quirk where if the print completes
 * immediately (usually the Flipper will mark a print complete with a single
 * packet turnaround), it asks for status a couple of times, then starts (presumably)
 * another status packet, but the second byte in the transfer is stopped mid-byte.
 * Between that point and the start of the next, real packet, is 30 ms, 32.6 ms
 * if you go from end of last byte received to start of next, real packet.
 *
 * This means there is some "soft" timeout that the printer uses to reset a packet
 * transfer in progress, but don't reset the whole printer state.
 *
 * There are wisps of some "unknown" bit timeout of 1.49 ms. But I've not yet
 * seen that in action.
 *
 * As far as I know, no one has dumped and reverse engineered the ROM of the
 * Game Boy Printer directly. I think all of the existing documentation was from
 * reverse engineering the communication channel. Maybe someday I'll dump the
 * GB Printer ROM and try to better understand all of it.
 *
 * Additionally, the gameboy camera seems to hint at a 2 second busy timeout, that
 * is that the printer needs to return a printing status within 2 seconds of starting
 * the print. There is also a hint of a 20 second print timeout, that is that the
 * printer needs to return print complete within 20 seconds of starting the print.
 * These two values are not really used in this library yet.
